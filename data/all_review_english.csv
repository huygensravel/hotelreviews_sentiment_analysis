181,Madagascar Underground,4,"Place quite close to downtown but far at the same time, which provide with both peace and connection to the city. It is placed in a hill next to the centre. Clean place, at least the independent high house on the stairs, rustic and very authentic. Staff is quite nice and a good local breakfast can be arranged."
182,Madagascar Underground,2,"The only normal option for staying at Tana. Still, dorms and rooms are very expansive as for what you get. Staff is helpful and knows English very well but the managers are very unpleasant. During a 40 days trip in Madagascar I had to stay there several times and I got the feeling that this place is managed by very greedy people."
183,Madagascar Underground,5,"Seriously best backpacker option in Tana, wonderful and friendly staff, very chill vibrant vibe and decent clean rooms. Food and beverage is pretty darn awesome too. Staff are also more than happy to help set you up with ways to explore ‚Ä¶"

208,Mantadia Lodge,5,Beautiful views and north American level comfort. Best beds in Madagascar by far. Food was also top notch but selection is a bit limited. I recommend the nightly malagasy featured dish as it was excellent every night. Hot water in the shower but ran out quickly with 2 showers back to back. Great pool area. Drinks are bit pricey.
209,Mantadia Lodge,3,"Nice new hotel, clean spacious rooms. The staff were not really helpful or friendly. Food was OK and service around food was poor. They need some customer service training!"
210,Mantadia Lodge,4,"Mantadia lodge is the equivalent of a lower end boutique European hotel. The rooms are bright and incredibly comfortable. It would get five stars if it wasn‚Äôt for the food, you will pay a premium for both bland and uninventive dishes. We ‚Ä¶"

812,1 Hotel Kuchai Lama,1,The hotel room looked different from photos on website. The hotel room seems like for those who go for one night stand. The price for booking at trivago is higher than price shown at the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel for others.

855,T - Bukit Bintang,5,Recommend not to stay in this hotel if you want a good night sleep. I recommend a visit here simply for their hospitality. Amazing value for what you pay. Central location means all the day noisy. All in all a good hotel in a good location with great transport connections.
856,T - Bukit Bintang,5,"Price OK for single, more excellent everything nearly to me. Good Hotel."

863,Grocer's Inn,2,"Internet here is a disaster, if you need to check something or book next accommodation it's unusable."
865,Grocer's Inn,3,Great restaurant and staff. The private room with shared bath was small but clean and adequate for a one night stay. Unfortunately the walls are little more than partitions and you can hear everything.

904,21 Capsule Hotel Bukit Bintang,5,I liked that it was in the heart of Bukit Butang. It was close(2 blocks )to the free city bus . You could also walk to a lot of places inc the towers (about 25-30 minutes). The people were cool there. ‚Ä¶

926,Hotel Tang City,2,"Great wifi and location. Those are the only nice things to say about it. Reaked of mildew and cigarettes, mold stained the ceilings, and blankets/sheets were burned with cigarettes so that they were full of holes. Had the ambience of a 70's motel that had been burned down."
927,Hotel Tang City,5,"The rooms are quite good, with ac and wifi. Given 53 rm per night the housekeeping and other amenities are very good. A 3 min walk to Mcdonalds and 6 min walk to the central market, and it is in the petaling street itself. Overall enjoying my stay."
